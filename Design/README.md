# Restaurant Simulator - Design Directory

Welcome to the "Restaurant Simulator" project with at least 10 design patterns. The Visual Paradigm link provided [here](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/share.jsp?id=323739313038302d31) is a valuable resource for understanding the system's architecture and design.

### Visual Paradigm Diagrams

- Link: [Visual Paradigm Diagrams](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/share.jsp?id=323739313038302d31)
- Description: The provided Visual Paradigm link contains various diagrams illustrating the architecture, design patterns, and relationships within our "Restaurant Simulator" project. These diagrams serve as a comprehensive reference for the project's design.
