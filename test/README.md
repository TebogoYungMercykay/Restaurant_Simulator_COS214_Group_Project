# Restaurant Simulator - Test

The "test" directory is dedicated to testing our "Restaurant Simulator". In this folder, you'll find unit tests, integration tests, and test data to ensure the robustness and correctness of our Implementation. Testing is a crucial part of our development process, so please contribute to and run tests as needed. For guidance on testing procedures, consult with our team members.

## Requirements before Testing Code:

- Install an `IDE` that compiles and runs C++ code.

  - 1st Recommendation: `VS Code`
  - 2nd Recommendation: `IntelliJ IDEA`
  - 3rd Recommendation: `Visual Studio`
- Setup Video:

  - Title: How to set up WSL Ubuntu terminal shell and run it from Visual Studio Code
  - Video Link: [Youtube-Video-Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp45HpZuhS8&t=112s)
  - Installing Coverage (Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)):
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get install gcov
    - sudo apt-get install lcov
    - which gcov
    - which lcov
  - Installing Valgrind (Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)):
    - sudo apt-get install valgrind

## How To Run The Code:

- ##### `Running the Project:`

  - Step 1: First you will need to Clone/Download the Git Repository into a Local Folder.
  - Step 2: Change Directory into the src Folder Location, `cd src`.
  - Step 3: You will then Run the `cmake CMakeLists.txt` Command on the Terminal under the src DIR, This will Generate the Makefile.
  - Step 4: To Run the Program then Run the `make` Command on the Terminal under the src DIR, Followed by `./main` on the same Terminal Window.
  - Final: The Restaurant Simulation Shall begin

- ##### `Testing the Project:`

  - Step 1: First you will need to Clone/Download the Git Repository into a Local Folder.
  - Step 2: Change Directory into the test Folder Location, `cd test`.
  - Step 3: You will then Run the `cmake CMakeLists.txt` Command on the Terminal under the test DIR, This will Generate the Makefile.
  - Step 4: To Run the Program then Run the `make` Command on the Terminal under the test DIR, Followed by `./main` on the same Terminal Window.
  - Final: The Test Cases for the Simulation Shall begin
