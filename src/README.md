## Restaurant Simulator Project - Source Directory (src)

Welcome to the "src" directory of our "Restaurant Simulator" project. This is where the actual implementation of our restaurant simulation code resides. In this directory, you'll find the source code, classes, and modules that bring our simulator to life.

Please organize your code thoughtfully, follow coding standards, and maintain clear comments for easy collaboration and maintenance. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our fellow team members.

## Project Tasks

- ### Task 1: Practical Assignment 5


  - `1.1 Partial UML Class Diagrams`:

    - Submit partial UML class diagrams for at least 3 patterns to be used in the system.
  - `1.2 UML Diagrams`:

    - Provide UML diagrams (activity, state, etc.) as specified in the submission.
  - `1.3 Coding Standards`:

    - Research and write up a coding standards diagram, including naming standards and git standards.
- ### Task 2: Design


  - `2.1 Requirements Identification`:

    - Identify the requirements of the system and document them in your report.
  - `2.2 Activity Diagrams`:

    - Model processes using activity diagrams based on the identified requirements.
  - `2.3 Pattern Identification`:

    - Identify patterns that complement the processes and requirements.
  - `2.4 Design Patterns`:

    - Incorporate a minimum of 10 distinct design patterns into the project.
  - `2.5 UML Class Diagram`:

    - Draft a complete UML class diagram for the entire project, considering potential multiple pattern participation.
  - `2.6 Sequence and Communication Diagrams`:

    - Create sequence and communication diagrams to illustrate message passing in the system.
  - `2.7 State Diagram`:

    - Provide a state diagram showing how an object might change state as time passes in the system.
  - `2.8 Object Diagrams`:

    - Present object diagrams to illustrate the state of objects in the system during runtime.
- ### Task 3: Implementation


  - `3.1 Implementation`

    - Implement the design from the previous section, including at least a text-based interface.
  - `3.2 GUI (Optional)`

    - Although not mandatory, the use of a GUI can earn extra marks.
  - `3.3 Coding Standards Implementation`

    - Consider implementing coding standards in your linter for bonus marks.
  - `3.4 Version Control (Git)`

    - Utilize Git and GitHub, with each team member expected to make at least 10 significant commits.
  - `3.5 Documentation`

    - Document your code using Doxygen.
  - `3.6 Unit Testing`

    - Set up unit testing, with every team member responsible for writing unit tests (full coverage not required).
  - `3.7 Integration with GitHub Jobs (Optional)`

    - Integrating unit tests with GitHub jobs is optional but can earn extra marks.
- ### Task 4: Report


  - Create a PDF document containing the following:
  - `4.1 Research Write-Up`

    - Document all research conducted for the assignment, including references.
  - `4.2 Design Rationale`

    - Explain the reasoning behind the design decisions made.
  - `4.3 Pattern Utilization`

    - Describe how all the patterns have been used and the problems they solved in the implementation.
  - `4.4 Assumptions and Alterations`

    - Provide information on any assumptions, alterations, or design decisions made during the project.
  - `4.5 UML Diagrams`

    - Include UML diagrams that support the content of the report.
- ### Task 5: Demonstration


  - Ensure the entire team is present at the demonstration.
  - You will be evaluated on your demo preparedness and presentation skills.
- ### Task 6: Bonus Task
- `6.1 GUI (Bonus Marks)`

  - Earn bonus marks for incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI).
- `6.2 DevOps (Bonus Marks)`

  - Gain bonus marks for implementing DevOps practices, including linter and CI/CD.

## Requirements before running Source Code:

- Install an `IDE` that compiles and runs C++ codes.

  - 1st Recommendation: `VS Code`
  - 2nd Recommendation: `IntelliJ IDEA`
  - 3rd Recommendation: `Visual Studio`
- Setup Video:

  - Title: How to set up WSL Ubuntu terminal shell and run it from Visual Studio Code
  - Video Link: [Youtube-Video-Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp45HpZuhS8&t=112s)

## How To Run The Code:

- ##### `Running the Project:`

  - Step 1: First you will need to Clone/Download the Git Repository into a Local Folder.
  - Step 2: Change Directory into the src Folder Location, `cd src`.
  - Step 3: You will then Run the `cmake CMakeLists.txt` Command on the Terminal under the src DIR, This will Generate the Makefile.
  - Step 4: To Run the Program then Run the `make` Command on the Terminal under the src DIR, Followed by `./main` on the same Terminal Window.
  - Final: The Restaurant Simulation Shall begin

- ##### `Testing the Project:`

  - Step 1: First you will need to Clone/Download the Git Repository into a Local Folder.
  - Step 2: Change Directory into the test Folder Location, `cd test`.
  - Step 3: You will then Run the `cmake CMakeLists.txt` Command on the Terminal under the test DIR, This will Generate the Makefile.
  - Step 4: To Run the Program then Run the `make` Command on the Terminal under the test DIR, Followed by `./main` on the same Terminal Window.
  - Final: The Test Cases for the Simulation Shall begin
