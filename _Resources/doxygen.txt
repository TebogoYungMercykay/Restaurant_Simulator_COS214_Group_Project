param => 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7730409/difference-between-paramout-and-return-in-doxygen

Out parameters are different from return values. Take this example in C:

/**
 * \param[in]  val      Value calculations are based off (input parameter).
 * \param[out] variable Function output is written to this variable (output parameter).
 *
 * \return Nothing
 */
void modify_value(int val, int *variable)
{
    val *= 5;
    int working = val % 44;
    *variable = working;
}


The function returns nothing, but the value to which *variable* points is changed, hence we call it 
an output parameter. It represents an 'output' of the function in that we expect it to be modified 
somehow by the function. val, on the other hand, is an 'input' parameter because it is not modified 
(and, indeed, cannot be modified from the perspective of the function's caller, 
since it is passed as a value).

====ANOTHER EXAMPLE=====

typedef struct data {
    int i;
    int j;
    ...
} data;

/**
 * \param[in]  val Initializing parameter for data (input parameter).
 * \param[out] dat Data pointer where the new object should be stored. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when it's no longer needed (output parameter).
 *
 * \return True if the object was created successfully, false if not (i.e., we're out of memory or encounter an error).
 */
bool create_data(int val, data **dat)
{
    data *newdata;
    newdata = (data*)malloc(sizeof(data));
    if(newdata == NULL)
    {
        *dat = NULL;
        return false;
    }
    newdata->i = val;
    *dat = newdata;
    return true;
}


In this case, we construct some complex object inside the function. We return a simple status flag that lets 
the user know the object creation was successful. But we pass out the newly-created object using an out parameter.

(Although, of course, this function could easily just return a pointer. Some functions are more complex!)
