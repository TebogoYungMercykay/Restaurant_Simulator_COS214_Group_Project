# Directory: Restaurant Simulator Project Diagrams

Welcome to the repository for our group project, the "Restaurant Simulator." This directory houses a collection of diagrams crucial for visualizing and documenting various aspects of our restaurant simulation project. These diagrams are instrumental in modeling and understanding different processes and interactions within our project. Please find below an overview of the contents in this directory, which will serve as a valuable resource for our collaborative efforts.

### Activity Diagrams

- Folder: `Activity Diagrams`
- Description: The `Activity Diagrams` folder contains diagrams representing the workflow and activities within our restaurant simulator project. These diagrams help us understand the steps involved in different restaurant operations and customer interactions.

### Communication Diagrams

- Folder: `Communication Diagrams`
- Description: In the `Communication Diagrams` folder, you will find diagrams illustrating the interactions and communications between various components and staff members within our restaurant simulation. These are crucial for coordinating the flow of information and tasks.

### Class Diagrams

- Folder: `Class Diagrams`
- Description: `Class Diagrams` depict the structure and relationships between classes and objects in our restaurant simulation project. These diagrams are essential for visualizing the architecture and design of our software components.

### Object Diagrams

- Folder: `Object Diagrams`
- Description: The `Object Diagrams` folder contains diagrams representing specific instances, such as tables, orders, and customers, within our restaurant simulation. These diagrams help us understand real-world scenarios and the relationships between objects.

### Sequence Diagrams

- Folder: `Sequence Diagrams`
- Description: In the `Sequence Diagrams` folder, you will find diagrams illustrating the order of interactions and messages exchanged between components in our restaurant simulation. These are essential for understanding how various elements interact in a dynamic manner.

### State Diagrams

- Folder: `State Diagrams`
- Description: The `State Diagrams` folder contains diagrams representing the states and transitions of elements within our restaurant simulation. These diagrams help us model how components change state in response to different events, such as order processing and table availability.

These diagrams play a critical role in enhancing our team's understanding of the "Restaurant Simulator" project, facilitating effective communication, and supporting our documentation efforts.
